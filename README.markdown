iBcryptPwdHash
==============

The iOS app version of [BcryptPwdHash](https://github.com/daijo/BcryptPwdHash).

Modified version of the Stanford PwdHash. The original PwdHash generates theft-resistant passwords but uses a weak hashing method. This is the same thing but using the stronger Bcrypt hashing. It requires you to keep a randomly generated salt to retrive your hashed password later.
